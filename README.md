# kali-quicksh

A script tailored to quickly set up kali for me, I'm sorry for the echo messages.

### Before you do

This script:

- Uses i3 + i3blocks
- Installs some tools
- Iosevka and Roboto Nerd Font, but it's optional and false by default.
- Removes some xfce, also optional

### How to use?

Simply download the bash script (setup.sh), and run:

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh
```

To know the optional parameters, type:

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh --help
```
