# kali-quicksh

A script tailored to quickly set up kali for me, I'm sorry for the echo messages.

### Before you do

This config uses Iosevka and Roboto Nerd Font, but it's optional and false by default.

### How to use?

Simply download the bash script (setup.sh), and run:

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh [--install-fonts]
```

> [!WARNING]
> Only execute post_setup.sh AFTER rebooting and only if you want to remove some xfce components
